This project aimed to compare binary classification in two-dimensional datasets. Four simulated datasets were analyzed using three different optimization methods. The results enable an evaluation of the effectiveness and accuracy of each method in binary classification.
This project is part of the Numerical Probabilities and Computational Statistics course at Sorbonne University and was carried out in collaboration with my colleague Mahir DURSUNOGLU.
